## Cory Martin's application project for the Houston Astros

I was tasked with building a video player that allows the user to view video from each pitch in the Astros game from 6/14/2015

I chose [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) as the back-end PHP Framework, and [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) as the front end Javascript Framework. I also used a template, purchased from [WrapBootstrap](https://wrapbootstrap.com/) as a visual framework.

## Database Structure and Seeding

The database/migrations folder contains information which defines the database structure for the project. The database/seeds folder contains information about processing the Raw Data, which can be found in the storage/data folder

## Hosting

As of May 10, 2016, the project is hosted at [http://astros.corymmartin.com/](http://astros.corymmartin.com/). Feel free to peruse it there.
